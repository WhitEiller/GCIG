To score the entities' contribution to the question, we need to determine which entities are relevant to the question and have a higher likelihood of being the correct answer.
In this case, we are looking for an actress who was a cast member of "Saturday Night Live" and starred in the movie "Staten Island Summer." Based on this information, we can eliminate entities that are not actresses or were not cast members of "Saturday Night Live."
The relevant entities that meet these criteria are:\n- Ashley Greene\n- Cecily Strong\n- Fred Armisen\n- Gina Gershon\n- Kate Walsh\n\nTo distribute the scores, we can assign a higher score to entities that are more likely to be the correct answer. In this case, the most likely answer would be an actress who was a cast member of "Saturday Night Live" around the time the movie was released.
Based on this reasoning, the scores could be assigned as follows:\n- Ashley Greene: 0\n- Cecily Strong: 0.4\n- Fred Armisen: 0.2\n- Gina Gershon: 0\n- Kate Walsh: 0.4
